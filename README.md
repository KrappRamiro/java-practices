# Java Practices

A repository including some practices for Java. I practiced the most interesting exercises from java-programming.mooc.fi, and i included them in this repository.
Not all the exercises I did are in this repo, only the most interesing/complex

## How to run

**IMPORTANT:** You have to have a JDK and JRE installed

1. using the terminal, `cd` into each exercise folder (eg, `cd Clock`)
2. compile and run the file using the following command: `javac Main.java && java Main`
